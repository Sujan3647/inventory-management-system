## Inventory Management System

This project aims to create Inventory Management System, which will enhance your skills in backend development using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB with Mongoose.

Project Overview:
Your primary goal is to create a Inventory Management System that enables users to manage products efficiently. The system should allow users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on products and implement inventory tracking features.

Project Details:

1. Product Management:

- Implement functionalities for adding, updating, and deleting products.
- Include attributes such as product name, description, supplier, sales, price, and quantity.

2. Inventory Listing:

- Display details of all products in the inventory.
- (Optional) Display the details of a specific product.

Create APIs to handle the CRUD operations for products (i.e. Product Management and Inventory Listing).

3. Database Connectivity:
   Utilize MongoDB in conjunction with Node.js for efficient and scalable backend development when storing product information in the Inventory Management System.

For those who are not familiar with MongoDB and Node.js, an alternative option is to store product information in the browser's LocalStorage. While this approach is acceptable, it is advisable to explore MongoDB for a more comprehensive and industry-relevant learning experience.
